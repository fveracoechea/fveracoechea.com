# debounce

Debouncing is a strategy used to improve the performance of a feature by
controlling the time at which a function should be executed.

It creates a debounced function that delays invoking `func` until after `wait`
milliseconds have elapsed since the last time the debounced function was
invoked. The debounced function comes with a `cancel` method to cancel delayed
`func` invocations.

The `func` is invoked with the last arguments provided to the debounced
function. Subsequent calls to the debounced function return the result of the
last `func` invocation.

```typescript
function debounce<Fn extends Callback>(wait: number, func: Fn) {
  let timeout: null | NodeJS.Timeout = null;

  function debounced(...args: any[]) {
    if (timeout !== null) clearTimeout(timeout);
    timeout = setTimeout(() => {
      func(...args);
      timeout = null;
    }, wait);
  }

  debounced.cancel = () => {
    if (timeout !== null) clearTimeout(timeout);
    timeout = null;
  };

  return debounced as DebouncedCallback<Fn>;
}

type Callback = (...args: any[]) => void;

type DebouncedCallback<Fn extends Callback> = Fn & {
  cancel(): void;
};
```
