  Asynchronous generator and `requestAnimationFrame` that creates a smooth
  typewriter effect by appending each character to text incrementally.

# Typewriter

The overall effect of this code is to create a typewriter animation. Characters
from the text string are appended one by one to an existing text (managed by
setText) with a slight delay between each character. The delay is managed using
requestAnimationFrame, which ensures the updates occur in sync with the
browser's animation frames, creating a smooth typing effect.

```typescript
function animationFrame() {
  return new Promise(resolve => requestAnimationFrame(resolve));
}

async function* typewriter(text: string, start: number = 0) {
  for (let index = start; index < text.length; index++) {
    const char = text[index];
    await animationFrame();
    yield char;
  }
}

for await (const chunck of typewriter(text)) {
  setText(text => text + chunk);
}
```
