# Named Actions

Resolves and invokes a named function from a given set of actions.

This utility is ideal for scenarios where behavior depends on a dynamic string
key â€” such as handling commands, user intents, or routing logic. It's especially
useful in **React Router v7** route modules, where multiple named action
handlers can be defined and invoked based on form submissions.

- Type-safe: key checking with [isKeyOf](/snippets/key-of/)
- Fallback support: Optional "default" action
- Declarative: Replaces switch or if/else chains
- React Router v7 ready: Clean action routing in loaders and actions

```ts
import { isKeyOf } from "./helpers.ts";

type ActionRecord = Record<string, () => unknown>;

export function namedAction<A extends ActionRecord>(
  name: unknown,
  actions: A,
) {
  if (name && isKeyOf(actions, name)) {
    const actionFn = actions[name];
    return actionFn() as ReturnType<A[keyof A]>;
  }

  if (isKeyOf(actions, "default")) {
    return actions.default() as ReturnType<A[keyof A]>;
  }

  if (!name) {
    throw new ReferenceError(
      `Action name not found, try providing a "default" action.`,
    );
  }

  throw new ReferenceError(
    `Action "${name}" not found, try providing a "default" action.`,
  );
}
```

## Example usage

### In React Router

When handling a form or data mutation, you might receive an action name from a
form submission and delegate it to the correct handler:

```ts
export async function action(
  { request, params: { linkId } }: Route.ActionArgs,
) {
  const formData = await request.formData();
  const intent = formData.get("intent")?.toString();

  return namedAction(intent, {
    async delete() {
      const res = await api.record.$delete({ linkId });
      return await res.json();
    },
    async favorite() {
      const res = await api.record.favorites.$put({ linkId });
      return await res.json();
    },
    async search() {
      const search = formData.get("search");
      const res = await api.record.search.$get({ search });
      return await res.json();
    },
    default() {
      throw redirect("/error-page");
    },
  });
}
```

### Error Handling

You can use it to map error codes to more user friendly messages

```ts
function getErrorMessage(code: number | undefined) {
  return namedAction(code, {
    400: () => "Bad request. Please check your input.",
    401: () => "Unauthorized. Please log in.",
    404: () => "Not found. The resource doesn't exist.",
    500: () => "Server error. Please try again later.",
    default: () => "Something went wrong. Try again.",
  });
}
```
