# useResizeObserver

Designed to monitor the size of a DOM element and update its dimensions whenever
the element is resized. It takes two arguments: a ref that points to a DOM
element and an optional callback function that is triggered whenever the
observed element's size changes.

The hook starts by initializing a state variable, this state holds the current
size of the observed element. It then uses `useLayoutEffect` hook to set up a
`ResizeObserver` that listens for resize events on the element referenced by
ref. When the ref is non-null, the current dimensions of the element are
immediately set into the size state.

The `ResizeObserver` is created to observe the element and update the size state
whenever the element's dimensions change. If a callback is provided, it is
invoked with the resize entry. The observer is cleaned up when the component
using this hook is unmounted or when the ref or callback changes.

```typescript
import { MutableRefObject, useLayoutEffect, useState } from "react";

export function useResizeObserver<T extends Element>(
  ref: MutableRefObject<T | null>,
  callback?: (entry: ResizeObserverEntry) => void,
) {
  const [size, setSize] = useState({ width: 0, height: 0 });

  useLayoutEffect(() => {
    if (!ref.current) return;

    setSize({
      width: ref.current.clientWidth,
      height: ref.current.clientHeight,
    });

    const observer = new ResizeObserver(([entry]) => {
      if (callback) callback(entry);
      setSize({
        width: entry.target.clientWidth,
        height: entry.target.clientHeight,
      });
    });

    observer.observe(ref.current);
    return () => observer.disconnect();
  }, [ref, callback]);

  return size;
}
```
