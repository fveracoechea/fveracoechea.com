  Asynchronous generator function that produces a sequence of animation frames.

# animationFrames

This function is designed to produce a continuous stream of animation frame
timestamps. Each time the browser is about to repaint, requestAnimationFrame is
called, the promise resolves, and the generator yields the timestamp of that
frame.

This allows any code using this generator to synchronize with the browser's
painting cycle, which is especially useful for tasks like measuring frame rates,
synchronizing animations, or performing time-based updates.

```typescript
async function* animationFrames() {
  while (true) {
    yield await new Promise<number>(resolve => requestAnimationFrame(resolve));
  }
}

async function run(label: string) {
  let numberOfFrames = 0;

  console.time(label);
  const startTime = performance.now();

  for await (const timestamp of animationFrames()) {
    if (performance.now() >= startTime + 1000) break;

    numberOfFrames++;
  }

  console.timeEnd(label);
  console.log("Number of frames: ", numberOfFrames);
}

run("animation 1");
```

When used in an asynchronous loop, **animationFrames** can help track how many
frames are rendered over a period of time.

For example, in the run function provided earlier, the `for await` loop iterates
over the frames produced by **animationFrames**, allowing it to measure how many
frames are rendered in one second.
