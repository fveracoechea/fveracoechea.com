Tailwind is a unopinionated **utility-first CSS framework** that offers great
flexibility, reliability and zero-runtime overhead. This makes it one of the
best and most popular solutions for styling.

## The problem

Although I love working with Tailwind, I've noticed some potential pitfalls when
creating larger components, such as those in a design system, which has many
different style variants.

As an example, let's look at the following component developed as part of a
design-system library:

```tsx
type ButtonProps = {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  modifier?: "contained" | "outlined" | "text";
  color?: "primary" | "success" | "danger";
  size?: "small" | "medium" | "large";
  disabled?: boolean;
};

function Button(props: ButtonProps) {
  const { children, modifier, color, size, disabled } = props;
  const className = "???";
  return <button className={className}>{children}</button>;
}
```

As you can see, this component can be rendered with three different modifiers:
**contained**, **outlined**, and **text**. Additionally, it has color and
disabled states for all these modifiers. The goal is to have a button that looks
and feels different based on the provided props.

### Manual class management

Tailwind provides an extensive set of utility classes for customizing styles.
However, managing and maintaining the class names for a complex component can
become quite difficult.

Anyways, let's explore how that can be accomplished...

### Exploration

Usually, I start by considering prop types, as they give me a better picture of
the component's behavior. Then, I might use an array to store all class names
and conditionally push `string` class names to the array based on the given
props. This could look like this:

```tsx
const styles: string[] = [
  "h-fit appearance-none rounded font-medium transition-colors",
];

if (variant === "contained") {
  styles.push("text-cat-mantle");
  if (disabled) styles.push("bg-cat-overlay2");
  else if (color === "primary") styles.push("bg-cat-blue hover:bg-cat-blue/80");
  else if (color === "success")
    styles.push("bg-cat-green hover:bg-cat-green/80");
  else if (color === "danger") styles.push("bg-cat-red hover:bg-cat-red/80");
}

const classNames = styles.join(" ");
return <button className={classNames}>{children}</button>;
```

Personally, I don't like this approach, we definitely need something more
declarative, let's try using [clsx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clsx) to
manage class names instead:

```tsx
const styles = clsx(
  "h-fit appearance-none rounded font-medium transition-colors",
  variant === "contained" && [
    "text-cat-mantle",
    disabled
      ? "bg-cat-overlay2"
      : [
          color === "primary" && "bg-cat-blue hover:bg-cat-blue/80",
          color === "success" && "bg-cat-green hover:bg-cat-green/80",
          color === "danger" && "bg-cat-red hover:bg-cat-red/80",
        ],
  ],
);

return <button className={styles}>{children}</button>;
```

It doesn't look as bad, but keep in mind it is just simply defining the styles
for the **contained** modifier, you can probably imagine how complicated it can
get as soon as you start adding all the other variants and modifiers.

Although it is viable, I feel like the implementation can become more and more
unmanageable over time, especially when adding new features and behaviors to the
component.

## Ideal solution

Even after organizing all the conditionals using
[clsx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clsx), it still isn't a clean enough way to
handle styles. It lacks structure and consistency, making the component's code
more difficult to follow and understand, especially as it grows in size.

Ideally, we would use a more declarative approach with a consistent structure
that helps:

- Identify all the possible variants and their corresponding modifiers
- Avoid className overlaps
- Apply special styles when more than one variant matches
- Define default styles in case none are provided
- Generate component Prop Types

## Class Variance Authority (CVA)

[CVA](https://cva.style/) is a library that caught my attention a few weeks ago.
Its goal is to alleviate the pain points of manually matching classes to props
and maintaining types in sync. Similar to [Stitches](https://stitches.dev/), it
introduces a more structured approach to styling, allowing me to focus on the
more enjoyable aspects of web UI development.

### Usage

CVA's first-class variant API can be summarized into the following three key
elements:

- `variants`: Used to define style variants. There is no limit to how many
  variants you can add, and they can be booleans.
- `compoundVariants`: Declares styles that should apply when multiple other
  variant conditions are met.
- `defaultVariants`: Defines default styles when none are provided.

In other words, you can design composable component APIs, you can define a
single variant, multiple variants, and even compound variants which allow you to
define styles based on a combination of variants.

Let's build a button component using CVA's variant API.

### Button Variants

```typescript
const button = cva(
  "h-fit appearance-none rounded font-medium transition-colors",
  {
    variants: {
      modifier: {
        contained: "text-cat-mantle",
        outlined: "border-2 bg-transparent",
        text: "bg-transparent",
      },
      color: {
        primary: "",
        success: "",
        danger: "",
      },
      size: {
        small: "px-4 py-1 text-sm",
        medium: "px-6 py-1.5 text-base",
        large: "px-8 py-2 text-lg",
      },
      disabled: {
        true: "cursor-not-allowed",
        false: "cursor-pointer",
      },
    },
    compoundVariants: [
      {
        modifier: "contained",
        color: "primary",
        disabled: false,
        className: "bg-cat-blue hover:bg-cat-blue/80",
      },
      {
        modifier: "contained",
        color: "success",
        disabled: false,
        className: "bg-cat-green hover:bg-cat-green/80",
      },
      {
        modifier: "contained",
        color: "danger",
        disabled: false,
        className: "bg-cat-red hover:bg-cat-red/80",
      },
      {
        modifier: "contained",
        color: ["primary", "success", "danger"],
        disabled: true,
        className: "bg-cat-overlay2",
      },
      {
        modifier: "outlined",
        color: "primary",
        disabled: false,
        className: "border-cat-blue text-cat-blue hover:bg-cat-blue/15",
      },
      {
        modifier: "outlined",
        color: "success",
        disabled: false,
        className: "border-cat-green text-cat-green hover:bg-cat-green/15",
      },
      {
        modifier: "outlined",
        color: "danger",
        disabled: false,
        className: "border-cat-red text-cat-red hover:bg-cat-red/15",
      },
      {
        modifier: "outlined",
        color: ["primary", "success", "danger"],
        disabled: true,
        className: "border-cat-overlay2 text-cat-overlay2",
      },
      {
        modifier: "text",
        color: "primary",
        disabled: false,
        className: "text-cat-blue hover:bg-cat-blue/15",
      },
      {
        modifier: "text",
        color: "success",
        disabled: false,
        className: "text-cat-green hover:bg-cat-green/15",
      },
      {
        modifier: "text",
        color: "danger",
        disabled: false,
        className: "text-cat-red hover:bg-cat-red/15",
      },
      {
        modifier: "text",
        color: ["primary", "success", "danger"],
        disabled: true,
        className: "text-cat-overlay2",
      },
    ],
    defaultVariants: {
      modifier: "contained",
      color: "primary",
      disabled: false,
      size: "medium",
    },
  },
);
```

### Button Component

```tsx
type ButtonProps = VariantProps<typeof button> & {
  children: ComponentChildren;
};

export default function Button(props: ButtonProps) {
  const { children, size, modifier, color, disabled } = props;

  const classNames = button({ modifier, color, size, disabled });

  return (
    <button className={classNames} disabled={disabled ?? false}>
      <span>{children}</span>
    </button>
  );
}
```

#### Contained

<comp.ButtonsDemo variant="contained" />

#### Outlined

<comp.ButtonsDemo variant="outlined" />

#### Text

<comp.ButtonsDemo variant="text" />

This library could be a game changer in the right situations, especially when it
comes to building complex style variants. With CVA, readability and
maintainability get a significant upgrade. No more hunting for a specific style
in a sea of class names. It just keeps things very well organized, allowing you
to focus on what matters.

## Wrapping Up

As with any tool, it's essential to weigh the pros and cons. While CVA excels in
developer convenience, you should monitor performance. As with any abstraction
layer, there may be trade-offs in terms of bundle size and runtime performance.
However, with a bit of optimization, the benefits far outweigh the trade-offs.

Overall, Class Variance Authority is a great solution to the challenges
associated with styling complex components in Tailwind projects. While it may
not be for everyone, CVA holds immense promise for streamlining styling
complexities and allowing developers to create remarkable interfaces.
