Tailwind is a unponionated **utility-first CSS framework** that offers great
flexibility, reliability and zero-runtime overhead, which makes it one of the
best and most popular solutions out there when it comes to styling.

## The problem

Although I love working with Tailwind, I've noticed some potential pitfalls when
creating bigger components, for example as part of a design-system, that has a
lot of different style variants.

As an example, let's look at the following component developed as part of a
design-system library:

```tsx
type ButtonProps = {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  modifier?: "contained" | "outlined" | "text";
  color?: "primary" | "success" | "danger";
  size?: "small" | "medium" | "large";
  disabled?: boolean;
};

function Button(props: ButtonProps) {
  const { children, modifier, color, size, disabled } = props;
  const className = "???";
  return <button className={className}>{children}</button>;
}
```

As you can see, this component may be rendered as one of three different
modifiers **contained**, **outlined**, and **text**. On top of that, it's got
**color** and **disabled** states for all these modifiers. The goal is to have a
button that may look and feel differently based on what props were provided to
it.

### Manually matching props to classNames

Tailwind provides an extensive set of utility classes to customize styles,
however at some point managing and maintaining the classNames required for a
component like that can become quite difficult.

Anyways, let's explore that can be accomplished...

### Exploration

Usually, I like to start thinking about prop types as they give me a better
picture of the components behavior. After that, my first thought would be to use
an array to store all classNames, then conditionally push `string` classNames to
the array depending the given props, that may look like this:

```tsx
const styles: string[] = [
  "h-fit appearance-none rounded font-medium transition-colors",
];

if (variant === "contained") {
  styles.push("text-cat-mantle");
  if (disabled) styles.push("bg-cat-overlay2");
  else if (color === "primary") styles.push("bg-cat-blue hover:bg-cat-blue/80");
  else if (color === "success")
    styles.push("bg-cat-green hover:bg-cat-green/80");
  else if (color === "danger") styles.push("bg-cat-red hover:bg-cat-red/80");
}

const classNames = styles.join(" ");
return <button className={classNames}>{children}</button>;
```

Personally I don't like this approach, we definitely need something more
declarative, let's try using [clsx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clsx) to
manage classNames instead:

```tsx
const styles = clsx(
  "h-fit appearance-none rounded font-medium transition-colors",
  variant === "contained" && [
    "text-cat-mantle",
    disabled
      ? "bg-cat-overlay2"
      : [
          color === "primary" && "bg-cat-blue hover:bg-cat-blue/80",
          color === "success" && "bg-cat-green hover:bg-cat-green/80",
          color === "danger" && "bg-cat-red hover:bg-cat-red/80",
        ],
  ],
);

return <button className={styles}>{children}</button>;
```

It doesn't look as bad, but keep in mind it is just simply defining the styles
for the **contained** modifier, you can probably imagine how complicated it can
get as soon as you start adding all the other variants and modifiers.

Although it is viable, I feel like implementation can become more and more
unmanageable overtime specially when adding new features and behaviors to the
component.

## The ideal solution

Even after doing my best to organize all the conditionals using
[clsx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clsx), that still isn't a clean enough way
to handle styles as it lacks a bit of structure and consistency, and thus making
the component's code more difficult to follow and understand specially as it
grows in size.

Ideally we would use a more declarative approach with a consistent structure
that helps:

- Identify all the possible variants and their corresponding modifiers
- Avoid className overlaps
- Apply special styles when more than one variants match
- Define default styles in case none are provided
- Generate component Prop Types

## Class variance authority

Also known as [CVA](https://cva.style/), it's library that caught my attention a
few weeks ago. Its goal is to take away the pain points of manually matching
classes to props and mainating types in sync. Much like
[Stitches](https://stitches.dev/), I feel like it introduces a more structured
approach to styling, allowing me to focus on the more fun aspects of web UI
development.

### Usage

CVA's first-class variant API can be summarized into the following three key
elements:

- `variants`: Key used to define style variants. There is no limit to how many
  variants you can add. They can be booleans by using "true" or "false" as the
  key.
- `compoundVariants`: Declares what styles should apply when multiple other
  variant conditions are met.
- `defaultVariants`: Defines what styles are as set default.

In other words, you can design composable component APIs, you can define a
single variant, multiple variants, and even compound variants which allow you to
define styles based on a combination of variants.

Letâ€™s build a button component, using CVA's variant API

### Button Variants

```typescript
const button = cva(
  "h-fit appearance-none rounded font-medium transition-colors",
  {
    variants: {
      modifier: {
        contained: "text-cat-mantle",
        outlined: "border-2 bg-transparent",
        text: "bg-transparent",
      },
      color: {
        primary: "",
        success: "",
        danger: "",
      },
      size: {
        small: "px-4 py-1 text-sm",
        medium: "px-6 py-1.5 text-base",
        large: "px-8 py-2 text-lg",
      },
      disabled: {
        true: "cursor-not-allowed",
        false: "cursor-pointer",
      },
    },
    compoundVariants: [
      {
        modifier: "contained",
        color: "primary",
        disabled: false,
        className: "bg-cat-blue hover:bg-cat-blue/80",
      },
      {
        modifier: "contained",
        color: "success",
        disabled: false,
        className: "bg-cat-green hover:bg-cat-green/80",
      },
      {
        modifier: "contained",
        color: "danger",
        disabled: false,
        className: "bg-cat-red hover:bg-cat-red/80",
      },
      {
        modifier: "contained",
        color: ["primary", "success", "danger"],
        disabled: true,
        className: "bg-cat-overlay2",
      },
      {
        modifier: "outlined",
        color: "primary",
        disabled: false,
        className: "border-cat-blue text-cat-blue hover:bg-cat-blue/15",
      },
      {
        modifier: "outlined",
        color: "success",
        disabled: false,
        className: "border-cat-green text-cat-green hover:bg-cat-green/15",
      },
      {
        modifier: "outlined",
        color: "danger",
        disabled: false,
        className: "border-cat-red text-cat-red hover:bg-cat-red/15",
      },
      {
        modifier: "outlined",
        color: ["primary", "success", "danger"],
        disabled: true,
        className: "border-cat-overlay2 text-cat-overlay2",
      },
      {
        modifier: "text",
        color: "primary",
        disabled: false,
        className: "text-cat-blue hover:bg-cat-blue/15",
      },
      {
        modifier: "text",
        color: "success",
        disabled: false,
        className: "text-cat-green hover:bg-cat-green/15",
      },
      {
        modifier: "text",
        color: "danger",
        disabled: false,
        className: "text-cat-red hover:bg-cat-red/15",
      },
      {
        modifier: "text",
        color: ["primary", "success", "danger"],
        disabled: true,
        className: "text-cat-overlay2",
      },
    ],
    defaultVariants: {
      modifier: "contained",
      color: "primary",
      disabled: false,
      size: "medium",
    },
  },
);
```

### Button Component

```tsx
type ButtonProps = VariantProps<typeof button> & {
  children: ComponentChildren;
};

export default function Button(props: ButtonProps) {
  const { children, size, modifier, color, disabled } = props;

  const classNames = button({ modifier, color, size, disabled });

  return (
    <button className={classNames} disabled={disabled ?? false}>
      <span>{children}</span>
    </button>
  );
}
```

#### Contained

<comp.ButtonsDemo variant="contained" />

#### Outlined

<comp.ButtonsDemo variant="outlined" />

#### Text

<comp.ButtonsDemo variant="text" />

This library could be a game changer in the right situations, specially when it
comes to building complex style variants. With CVA, readability and
maintainability get a significant upgrade. No more hunting for specific a style
in a sea of classNames. It just keeps things very well organized, allowing you
to focus on what matters.

## Wrapping Up

As with any tool, it's essential to weigh the pros and cons. While CVA shines in
terms of developer convenience, keep an eye on performance. As with any
abstraction layer, there may be trade-offs in terms of bundle size and runtime
performance. But with a bit of optimization, the benefits far outweigh the
trade-offs.

Overall, Class Variance Authority is a great solution to the challenges
associated with styling complex components in Tailwind projects. While it may
not be for everyone, CVA holds immense promise for streamlining styling
complexities and allows developers to create remarkable interfaces.
