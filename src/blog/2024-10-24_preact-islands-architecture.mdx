You may have heard the term "Islands Architecture" being use online, usually
it's most commonly associated with frameworks like Astro and Fresh.

That's why to some extend, it may seem like these frameworks are doing magic
behind the scenes, however the main goal of this article is to demonstrate how
to implement this pattern, as it can be done in any type of website with just a
little bit of Javascript.

## The islands architecture

First of all, what is the islands architecture?

The overall main idea of this architecture is to inject the absolute minimum
amount of Javascript possible, while having a good balance between interactivity
and SEO via Server Side Rendering (SSR) or Static Site Generation (SSG) also
known as pre-rendering.

Since this is a component-based architecture, we can separate the static
(non-interactive HTML) components from the dynamic and interactive ones that
need some Javascript to work.

At which point, we only `hydrate` (download Javascript) for specific components
that require some type of client-site interactivity, while the other static
regions of the page are pure non-interactive HTML that do not require hydration.

Let's imagine a website that looks like the following:

<comp.IslandsDemo />

As you may have noticed, most of the user-interface is pretty much
non-interactive components that can be rendered at the server or build time,
only a few components need JS to execute some kind of client site code.

Here are a couple resources, in case you'd like to dig more in to this subject:

Alright, enough talk, let's start writing some code...

## Technologies

We are going to base our islands implementation on the following technologies:

### Vite

### Preact

### Web-components standard
