You may have heard the term "Islands Architecture" being use online, usually
it's most comontly associated with frameworks like Astro and Fresh.

That's why to some extend, it may seem like these frameworks are doing magic
behind the scens, however the main goal of this article is to demonstrate how to
do implement architecture, as it can be done in any type of websice with just a
little bit of Javascript.

## The islands architecture

First of all, what is the islands architecture?

The overall main idea of this architecture is to inject the absolute minimum
amount of Javascript possible, while having a good balance between interactivity
and SEO via Server Side Rendering (SSR) or Static Site Generation (SSG) also
known as pre-rendering.

As this is a component-based architecture, we can separate the static
(non-interactive HTML) components from the dynamic and interactive ones that
need some Javascript to work.

Basically, we only `hydrate` (download Javascript) for specific components that
require some type of client-site interactivity, while the other static regions
of the page are pure non-interactive HTML that do not require hydration.

Let's take a look that the following example:

Alright, enough talk, let's start writing some code...

## Custom implementation

We are going to base our islands implementation on the following technologes:

### Vite

### Preact

### Web-components standard
