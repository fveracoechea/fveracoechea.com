You may have heard the term "Islands Architecture" being use online, usually
it's most commonly associated with frameworks like [Astro](https://astro.build/)
and [Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/).

Because of it, to some extend it could look like these frameworks are doing
magic behind the scenes, that's why the main goal of this article is to
demonstrate how to implement this pattern, and hopefully give you a better idea
about how this type of optimizations work, as it can be done in any type of
website with just a little bit of JavaScript.

## The islands architecture

First of all, what is the islands architecture?

The overall main idea of this architecture is to inject the absolute minimum
amount of Javascript possible, while having a good balance between
interactivity, performance, and SEO, the latter is usually achieved via either
Server Side Rendering (SSR) or Static Site Generation (SSG) also known as
pre-rendering.

Since this is a component-based architecture, we can separate the static
(non-interactive) components from the ones that need some client-side JavaScript
to work.

At which point, we only **hydrate** (load JS for) specific components that
provide some kind of user interactivity, while the other static regions of the
page stay as pure non-interactive HTML that do not require hydration.

Let's imagine a website that looks like the following:

<comp.IslandsDemo />

I'm sure you noticed, most of the user interface is pretty much made of
non-interactive elements that can be rendered at the server or build time, only
a few components need JavaScript to execute some kind of client site code. This
is specially true when it comes to content driven websites like marketing sites,
blogs, and e-commerce.

## Technologies

Let's break down the technologies we'll actually be using for this exercise:

### Vite

> The Build Tool for the Web

Simply put, [Vite](https://vite.dev/) is one of the best JavaScript build tools
available. It's really fast, easy to use, and UI agnostic, meaning it can bundle
various frontend frameworks, Preact being one of them.

### Preact

> Fast 3kB alternative to React with the same modern API

When it comes to islands architecture, [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) is my UI
framework of choice. Its main selling points are:

1. Familiar React-like API with support for JSX, Hooks, function components,
   Context, and even Suspense.
2. Overall better performance and a _hilariously_ smaller in bundle size.

Here is a quick comparison:

- [react](https://bundlephobia.com/package/react@18.3.1) +
  [react-dom](https://bundlephobia.com/package/react-dom@18.3.1) +
  [react-router-dom](https://bundlephobia.com/package/react-router-dom@6.28.0) =
  **70.8kB** <small>minified and gzipped</small>
- [preact](https://bundlephobia.com/package/preact@10.24.3) +
  [preact-iso](https://bundlephobia.com/package/preact-iso@2.8.1) = **6.7kB**
  <small>minified and gzipped</small>

That is **64.1kB** - a huge **165%** difference!! so let's remember with islands
we are looking to inject the minimum amount of Javascript possible, using Preact
sounds like the more reasonable approach.

### Web components

> A web standard for creating reusable UI elements

Well, kind of ðŸ˜ƒ... they turned out to be a very niche standard, but to be fair,
I think they got some really interesting use cases like in this specific
situation.

Weâ€™ll create a custom element that will work as a wrapper for specific Preact
components and will enable them to be hydrated independently. As a plus, we
could pass attributes to specify when hydration should happen, for example when
visible or when a given media query matches.

## The implementation

Enough talk, let's start writing some code...

### Scaffolding

First, let's generate a Vite + Preact project by running `pnpm craate preact` or
`npm init preact`, as well make sure to select the following options so that
both router and pre-rendering are enabled:

- Project language: **TypeScript**
- Use router?: **Yes**
- Prerender app (SSG)? **Yes**

After running `npm run dev` or `pnpm dev` you should see the following:

![Vite + Preact](/images/vite-preact.png)

### Preact islands

At this point, we want to allow for components to be rendered on the server as
placeholders and then hydrated into interactive elements on the client. Two key
functions make this happen:

```tsx
// src/lib/preact-islands.tsx
import type { FunctionalComponent, JSX } from "preact";
import hydrate from "preact-iso/hydrate";

export type IslandsConfig = Record<
  string,
  () => Promise<{ default: FunctionalComponent }>
>;

export function registerIslands<C extends IslandsConfig>(config: C) {
  customElements.define(
    "preact-island",
    class extends HTMLElement {
      async connectedCallback() {
        const src = this.getAttribute("src");

        if (!Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(config, src))
          throw new Error(`${src} is not a registered island`);

        const load = config[src];
        const Component = await load();
        hydrate(<Component.default />, this);
      }
    },
  );
}

export function withIsland<S, Props = {}>(
  Component: FunctionalComponent<Props>,
  displayName: string,
): FunctionalComponent<Props> {
  return (props: Props) => {
    if (typeof document !== "undefined") return <Component {...props} />;
    return (
      <preact-island src={displayName}>
        <Component {...props} />
      </preact-island>
    );
  };
}
```

Here is a quick breakdown:

**registerIslands()**

It's where most of the magic happens, basically this function registers a
`preact-island` custom element that tells the browser to lazy-load the
corresponding component's code (via `connectedCallback`), then hydrates it,
making it interactive.

**withIsland()**

A very simple higher-order component that marks a given Preact component as an
"island."

When running in the browser, it does during hydration, so it renders the
Component directly using any provided props. But when running on the server, it
renders the Component wrapped by a custom `<preact-island>` HTML tag with a
`src` attribute pointing to the name of the island.

**It is important to notice that `displayName` should match one of the keys in
the config object passed to `registerIslands()`.**

### Writing your first island

Let's start by building a simple button as our first island component. This
simple button will trigger a `window.alert` when clicked:

```tsx
// src/islands/Button.tsx
import { withIsland } from "../lib/preact-islands";

function Button() {
  return (
    <button
      style={{ width: 300, fontSize: 16 }}
      onClick={() => alert("Interactivity Yeah!!")}
    >
      <span>Button Island - Click me!</span>
    </button>
  );
}

export default withIsland(Button, "Button");
```

Notice that the component is wrapped with `withIsland()`, which requires the
component itself and a `displayName` as arguments. The `displayName` is used to
identify the component during hydration.

### Loading islads

Finally! The last piece of the puzzle! it is basically configuring Vite to
ensure only the necessary "islands" are sent to the browser, rather than the
entire app. Luckily this can be easily done using the dynamic `import()`
function, follow the next steps:

#### Move app component

First, copy/paste the main App component into a separate file:

```tsx
// src/App.tsx
import { LocationProvider, Route, Router } from "preact-iso/router";

import { Header } from "./components/Header.jsx";
import { Home } from "./pages/Home/index.jsx";
import { NotFound } from "./pages/_404.jsx";

export function App() {
  return (
    <LocationProvider>
      <Header />
      <main>
        <Router>
          <Route path="/" component={Home} />
          <Route default component={NotFound} />
        </Router>
      </main>
    </LocationProvider>
  );
}
```

#### Add code splitting

Now, modify the `src/index.tsx` entrypoint to handle different behaviors for
development and production:

```tsx
// src/index.tsx
import hydrate from "preact-iso/hydrate";
import render from "preact-iso/prerender";

import { registerIslands } from "./lib/preact-islands";
import "./style.css";

// the dev server (dev command) runs in development mode
const isDEV = import.meta.env.MODE === "development";
const isBrowser = typeof window !== "undefined";

if (isBrowser && isDEV) {
  // Hydrate the whole app while in development
  import("./App").then(({ App }) => {
    hydrate(<App />, document.getElementById("app"));
  });
}

if (isBrowser && !isDEV) {
  // Only hydrate Islands in production
  registerIslands({
    Button: () => import("./islands/Button"),
  });
}

export async function prerender(data) {
  const { App } = await import("./App");
  return await render(<App {...data} />);
}
```

Please make sure you notice the following:

- **In development**, the entire app is hydrated to simplify debugging.
- **In production**, only the defined islands are hydrated using the
  `registerIslands()` function.
- **Button key** in the `registerIslands()` configuration matches the
  `displayName` arg provided to `withIsland()`. This link is really important
  for identifying and loading the correct island dynamically.

### Render it on the page!

At this point, we should we able to render our button island anywhere on the
page, so let's do that and run:

```sh
npm run build && npm run preview
```

This is what you would get on `localhost:4173`:

![Button Island](/images/button-island.png)

Not so fast, there are a couple more thigs I'd like to mention...

I'd suggest adding the following snippet to your global CSS styles:

```css
preact-island {
  display: contents;
}
```

It should help preventing styling issues if any, by making it so that the custom
element is not perceived as a box by the browser, and instead is replaced by its
child.

Also if you are using TypeScript and I hope you are... add the following snippet
somewhere in the code, it would make TypeScript recognize `preact-island` as a
usable html tag:

```ts
declare module "preact/jsx-runtime" {
  namespace JSX {
    interface IntrinsicElements {
      "preact-island": JSX.HTMLAttributes<HTMLElement>;
    }
  }
}
```
