Tailwind is a unponionated **utility-first CSS framework** that offers great
flexibility, reliability and zero-runtime overhead, which makes it one of the
best and most popular solutions out there when it comes to styling.

## The problem

Although I love working with Tailwind, I've noticed some potential pitfalls when
creating bigger components, for example as part of a design-system, that has a
lot of different style variants.

Consider the scenario of creating a button component within a design system.
This button needs various states and styles, such as primary, secondary, and
destructive variants, along with disabled and loading states for each variant.
While Tailwind provides an extensive set of utility classes to customize styles,
managing the classNames for such a complex component can become messy and
unmaintainable.

### Button component

Think about a button that can be a primary, secondary, danger button and even
has a disabled and loading state for all these 3 variants:

| variant   | color   | size   | loading | disabled |
| --------- | ------- | ------ | ------- | -------- |
| contained | primary | small  | true    | true     |
| outlined  | success | medium | false   | false    |
| text      | danger  | large  |         |          |
