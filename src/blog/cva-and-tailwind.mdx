Tailwind is a unponionated **utility-first CSS framework** that offers great
flexibility, reliability and zero-runtime overhead, which makes it one of the
best and most popular solutions out there when it comes to styling.

## The problem

Although I love working with Tailwind, I've noticed some potential pitfalls when
creating bigger components, for example as part of a design-system, that has a
lot of different style variants.

Consider the scenario of creating a component within a design system.
This component needs various states and styles, such as **size, color, disabled,** etc. 
While Tailwind provides an extensive set of utility classes to customize styles,
managing and maintaing the `classNames` for such a complex component can become quite difficult overtime.

### Button component

Think about a button that can be a contained, outlined, text and even has a 
color, disabled and fullWidth state for all these 3 variants.

| variant   | color   | size   | fullWidth | disabled |
| --------- | ------- | ------ | --------- | -------- |
| contained | primary | small  | true      | true     |
| outlined  | success | medium | false     | false    |
| text      | danger  | large  |           |          |

If you thought that all those Tailwind classnames can become quite messy, then  you are right:
