### About me

Software engineer specialized in web applications technologies, who enjoys learning new
skills and helping teammates develop their own.

With over 5 years of experience, I've architected scalable web applications, lead teams
effectively, developed an expert-level understanding of **Javascript** and **Typescript**,
as well remarkable skills in modern technologies like ReacJs, NextJS, NodeJs, Graphql, and
ReactNative.

```typescript
async function coding(coffee) {
  if (coffee.isEmpty) return coffee.brew();

  coffee.drink();
  await work.execute();
  coding(coffee);
}
```
